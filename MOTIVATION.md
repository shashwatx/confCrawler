# Things to do

Peer review is the cornerstone to publication quality.
A journal/conference's reputation stems from fair review policy. 
Popular review policies include Single Blind, Double Blind, or Non Blind reviews.
There are no clear favorites in academia.
In particular much has been said about the pros and cons of Double Blind Reviewing system.

Past studies have attempted to study the effect of policy changes (single to double) w.r.t. their impact on prolific authors or experts. 

As opposed to compare review policies, we wish to simply _explore the data_ to uncover potential trends.
The primary aim of this repository, thus, is to serve as a playground to develop applications to perform a qualitative analysis of recent publications at major venues in computer science.
