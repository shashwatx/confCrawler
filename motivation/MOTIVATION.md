# Things to do

Peer review is the cornerstone to publication quality.
A journal/conference's reputation stems from fair review policy. 
Popular review policies include Single Blind, Double Blind, or Non Blind reviews.
There are no clear favorites in academia.
In particular much has been said about the pros and cons of Double Blind Reviewing system.

Past studies have attempted to study the effect of policy changes (single to double) w.r.t. their impact on prolific authors or experts. 

As opposed to compare review policies, we wish to simply _explore the data_ to uncover potential trends.
The primary aim of this repository, thus, is to serve as a playground to develop applications to perform a qualitative analysis of recent publications at major venues in computer science. 

Although these pieces are available as part of the official git
source tree, they are in somewhat different status.  The
intention is to keep interesting tools around git here, maybe
even experimental ones, to give users an easier access to them,
and to give tools wider exposure, so that they can be improved
faster.

Buzz words:

 - status bias
 - greater transparency
 - 'publish or perish' culture
 - no reasonable alternatives
 - cliquishness

Insights:

- However ill-defined it may be, the peer-review process is still the gold standard that will continue to drive scholarly publication. 
- Understandably, a large part of the responsibility for the success or failure of the peer-review process depends upon peer reviewers. 
- The importance of peer review has increased all the more due to the currently prevailing ‘publish or perish’ culture.
- To study the effectiveness of statistical approaches to optimize process parameters.
- We put to test the intuition or belief that it works.
- Lacks sufficient theoretical or empirical validation.
- The primary reason for continuation of existing review policies is not their effectiveness but a lack of reasonable alternatives.
- The jury for each paper is akin to an ensemble of weak classifiers; each reviewer spending less than the time required to judge the submission fairly.
- Increasing load on reviewers.
- Work by prolific authors given greater credence than work of similar calibre from non-prolific authors.

- Aim to improve overall quality of peer review in editorial management systems.
- Total objectivity is super natural (Ingerfinger 1974).
- May obscure a larger problem.
- There's a low correlation between peer review outcome and impact in time of the accepted contributions

We present results on 25 years of VLDB papers. Our study shows several interpretable trends and intereting trends artefacts.
