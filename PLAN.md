# Things to do

Peer review is the cornerstone to publication quality.
A journal/conference's reputation stems from fair review policy. 
Popular review policies include Single Blind, Double Blind, or Non Blind reviews.
There are no clear favorites in academia.
In particular much has been said about the pros and cons of Double Blind Reviewing system.

Past studies have attempted to study the effect of policy changes (single to double) w.r.t. their impact on prolific authors or experts. 

The aim of this study is to perform a qualitative analysis of peer review policies in major conferences and journals, comment on the effect of modifications in review policy.
In this paper, we take a different approach.
With the aid of data collected through confCrawler and using richer datasets and methods than previous studies we aim to uncover hidden patterns.
